#  Function Approximation with MLP and RBF Networks 

1. Created a MLP(Multilayer Perception) neural network to estimate the function y = x ^2 . Then, comparing the output of the network with the output of the function y = x ^ 2 in the range [-3, 3]. 


2. Created a RBF(Radial Basis Function) neural network to estimate the function y = x ^2. Then, comparing the output of the network with the output of the function y = x ^ 2 in the range [-3, 3].
